Welcome to my web app, which helps for fighting game players to find locals in SoCal (currently, functionality to filter by region will be added!) and plots them on a map for your convenience. The database of locals are currently user-uploaded and maintained.

On the tournaments page, the app will read from a database of tournaments and list their name and address on the side of a map, where they have been plotted onto a map.
The user may click the NEW link to open a form add tournaments to this database.

The user may click on a marker to see more details of a specified tournament, such as days and hours.
The user may click on a listed address to pan the map over to the marker where the tournament is located.

The user may click on the name of a tournament to view even more details, such as games included or any notes, or edit any of the tournaments details, or even delete the tournament from the database by double clicking the delete button (user authorization to be implemented).
